### Describe your implementation here...

First need to install packages with this command:

There I am using redux toolkit and custom DataTable to show the payment information

In the bottom of DataTable you can see the total amount for each tenats

And in the bottom of list you can also see the total amount of all payments

Every 30 seconds the API will be called and update the DataTable information
